# SimpleFitness

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an application where you can input your goals, height, age, weight, etc and be given a
workout plan and meal plan which will be created by OpenAI and saved to your account. (can be recreated as well with more criteria) 
In addition to this you will be able to log your Macros by simply clicking 
the corresponding button for what macro you want to add.

## Technologies

I am doing this project in C#/.NET in order to get better at the technology.
